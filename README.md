This is a Mobile RPG game in which you have to go through waves of enemies.

This game was created based on my idea, and it looked much better in my head.ðŸ˜…

The main gameplay is to kill enemies that constantly spawn, and after every third wave, the player can choose what to restore and the opportunity to get a new weapon or a new spell.
